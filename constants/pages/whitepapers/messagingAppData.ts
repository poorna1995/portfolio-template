        enables users to send and receive messages to and from other users. 
        The app is being built using Python + Django for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. 
        It should be functional, intuitive, and include features like user authentication, 
        inbox for received messages, sent box for sent messages, and a compose function for creating 
        and sending new messages. The project will be deployed on Ubuntu server, 
        and the completed project should be delivered within 2-3 days.`,
